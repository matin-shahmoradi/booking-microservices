- :sparkle: Using `gRPC` for `internal communication`.
- :sparkle: Using `CQRS` implementation with `MediatR` library.
- :sparkle: Using `Postgres` for `read & write` database.
- :sparkle: Using `Unit Testing` for testing small units and mocking our dependencies with `Xunit`.
- :sparkle: Using `Fluent Validation` and a `Validation Pipeline Behaviour` on top of `MediatR`.
- :sparkle: Using `Carter` for all endpoints.

## Key Features
1. **Independent Services**: Each service is a separate project with its own database.
2. **Decentralized Communication**: Services communicate via APIs (REST, gRPC) or message brokers (RabbitMQ), ensuring loose coupling and resilience.
3. **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand, allowing efficient resource utilization.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Failures are isolated, preventing cascading failures and ensuring high availability.
5. **Technology Agnostic**: Services can use different technologies, frameworks, or databases, providing flexibility.


## The Domain And Bounded Context - Service Boundary

- `Auth service`: The Identity Service is a bounded context for the authentication and authorization of users using Microsoft Identity.
-  This service is responsible for creating new users and their corresponding roles and permissions using [.Net Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity) and Jwt authentication and authorization.

- `Catalog service`: The Catalog Service is a bounded context `CRUD` service to handle managing tickets available in the platform.

- `Basket service `: The Basket Service is a bounded context for managing manages the user shopping basket.

- `Order service `: The Order Service is a bounded context for managing all operation related to booking ticket.

## Structure of Project

In this project, I used [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) at the architectural level and [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) to structure Catalog , Basket & Auth service for Order service I used [Clean architecture](https://medium.com/@rudrakshnanavaty/clean-architecture-7c1b3b4cb181)


I treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
When adding or changing a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many "layers" in an application. We are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice. We `minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.

With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.

Instead of grouping related action methods in one controller, as found in traditional ASP.net controllers, I used the [REPR pattern](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern). Each action gets its own small endpoint, consisting of a route, the action, and an `IMediator` instance (see [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)). The request is passed to the `IMediator` instance, routed through a [`Mediatr pipeline`](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) where custom [middleware](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/wiki/Behaviors) can log, validate and intercept requests. The request is then handled by a request specific `ICommandHandler` & `IQueryHandler` which performs business logic before returning the result.

The use of the [mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) in my controllers creates clean and [thin controllers](https://codeopinion.com/thin-controllers-cqrs-mediatr/). By separating action logic into individual handlers we support the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [Don't Repeat Yourself principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), this is because traditional controllers tend to become bloated with large action methods and several injected `Services` only being used by a few methods.

I used CQRS to decompose my features into small parts that makes our application:

- Maximize performance, scalability and simplicity.
- Easy to maintain and add features to. Changes only affect one command or query, avoiding breaking changes or creating side effects.
- It gives us better separation of concerns and cross-cutting concern (with help of mediatr behavior pipelines), instead of bloated service classes doing many things.

Using the CQRS pattern, we cut each business functionality into vertical slices, for each of these slices we group classes (see [technical folders structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders)) specific to that feature together (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, etc). In our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods.

## How to Run

> ### Config Certificate
Run the following commands to [Config SSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/docker-compose-https?view=aspnetcore-6.0) in your system:

#### Windows using Linux containers
```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p password
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```
> Note: for running this command in `powershell` use `$env:USERPROFILE` instead of `%USERPROFILE%`*

#### macOS or Linux
```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -ep ${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

> Note:The `Aspire dashboard` will be available at `http://localhost:18888`

> ### Docker Compose


To run this app in `Docker`, use the [docker-compose.yaml](./deployments/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) and execute the below command at the `root` of the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```


> ### Build
To `build` all microservices, run this command in the `root` of the project:
```bash
dotnet build
```

> ### Run
To `run` each microservice, run this command in the root of the `Api` folder of each microservice where the `csproj` file is located:
```bash
dotnet run
```

> ### Test

To `test` all microservices, run this command in the `root` of the project:
```bash
dotnet test
```

> ### Documentation Apis

Each microservice provides `API documentation` and navigate to `/swagger` for `Swagger OpenAPI` to visit list of endpoints.
